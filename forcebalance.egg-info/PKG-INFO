Description: 
        
            ForceBalance (https://simtk.org/home/forcebalance) is a library
            that provides tools for automated optimization of force fields and
            empirical potentials.
        
            The philosophy of this program is to present force field
            optimization in a unified and easily extensible framework.  Since
            there are many different ways in theoretical chemistry to compute
            the potential energy of a collection of atoms, and similarly many
            types of reference data to fit these potentials to, we do our best
            to provide an infrastructure which allows a user or a contributor
            to fit any type of potential to any type of reference data.
