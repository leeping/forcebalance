# The octothorpe '#' is a comment symbol
# Note: If the specified value is 'None' then the option will truly be set to None - not the string 'None'
# Note: 'Section' option types are more complicated and may require you to read the documentation
# Note: Boolean option types require no value, the key being present implies 'True'

# Normalize the objective function using the sum of weights?  I usually don't.
