# Readme for ForceBalance Poltype Wrapper

* Install modified forcebalance for tinker
```
git clone https://github.com/bdw2292/forcebalance.git
```

* ForceBalance conda environment
```
conda create --name FBTest python=3.8 --yes
conda activate FBTest
conda install -c conda-forge ndcctools --yes
conda install -c conda-forge forcebalance --yes
conda install pip --yes
conda install openbabel --yes
conda install -c conda-forge rdkit --yes
```

* If you want to use Tinker9's gpu dynamics, make sure that your bashrc for each Tinker9 env contains the below export statement as well as function for dynamics_gpu (to call GPU dynamics and not CPU dynamics) 
```
export GPUDYNAMICS=True
```

* Make sure Tinker is sourced in your path so program can use xyzedit!
* Environment Bashrc Example For CPU Tinker
```
conda activate FBTest
export PATH=/home/bdw2292/NewestTinker/bin:$PATH
```
* Make sure to copy files from modified forcebalance to conda site packages (for example mine are located /home/bdw2292/miniconda3/envs/FBTest/lib/python3.8/site-packages/forcebalance/) 
* Make a folder for input/outputs from ForceBalence and navigate to that folder
* Make a file called forcebalancepoltype.ini , inputs will go in here
* Call script via 
```
python /home/bdw2292/FBInterface/forcebalancepoltypeinterface.py
```
* Example input
```
poltypepathlist=/home/bdw2292/PoltypeJobs/HalogenPaperMolecules/CHI3,/home/bdw2292/PoltypeJobs/HalogenPaperMolecules/CF4 
vdwtypeslist=401 402 , 401 402  
temperature_list= 300 250 , 300 230 350 
pressure_list= 1 1 , 1 1 1 
density_list=1000 1000 , 1000 1000 1000 
fittypestogether=401 402 , 401 402
```
* In the example above, fittypestogether reads fit 401 from molecule 1 and 401 from molecule 2 together, and also fit 402 from molecule 1 and 402 from molecule 2 together
* Alternative example input
```
poltypepathlist=/home/bdw2292/PoltypeJobs/HalogenPaperMolecules/CHI3,/home/bdw2292/PoltypeJobs/HalogenPaperMolecules/CF4 
csvexpdatafile=ExpHalogenData.csv
vdwtypeslist=401 402 , 401 402  
```
* Dont let property values be blank for some TP points (need value for FB to read).
* If using csvexpdatafile, please use correct units as below and the column headers in example csv file, make sure the molecule name under the Name column are same as poltype molecule folder name
* By default all types in key files are reassigned new type numbers so there is no overlap while fitting together. So input types will be converted internally.
* temperature_list, pressure_list and density_list are required.
* Density units are Kg/m^3
* Enthalpy of vaporization units kJ/mol
* Thermal expansion units 1/K
* Isothermal compressibility units are 1/bar
* Isobaric heat capacity units are kJ/mol.K
* pressure units are atm
* Experimental data can be found at https://webbook.nist.gov/ or https://www.aiche.org/dippr
* QM energies from dimers in poltype (normalized) >=15 kcal/mol are removed and not use for forcebalance.
