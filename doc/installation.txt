\page installation Installation

This section covers how to install ForceBalance and its companion
software GROMACS-X2.  Currently only Linux is supported, though
installation on other Unix-based systems (e.g. Mac OS) should also be
straightforward.

Importantly, note that <em>ForceBalance does not contain any simulation
software or methods for generating the reference data</em>.  Fitting
simulations are performed by interfacing ForceBalance with simulation
software like GROMACS, TINKER or OpenMM; reference data is obtained
from experimental measurements (consult the literature), or from
simulation / quantum chemistry software (for example, NWChem or Q-Chem).

I have provided a specialized version of GROMACS (dubbed version
4.0.7-X2) on the <a href=https://simtk.org/home/forcebalance/>SimTK
website</a> which interfaces with ForceBalance through the
forceenergymatch_gmxx2 module.  Although interfacing with unmodified
simulation software is straightforward, GROMACS-X2 is optimized
for our task and makes things much faster.  Soon, I will also
implement functions for grid-scale computation of reference energies
and forces using Q-Chem (a commercial software).  However, you should
be prepared to write some simple code to interface with a fitting
simulation or quantum chemistry software of your choice.  If you
choose to do so, please contact me as I would be happy to include your
contribution in the main distribution.

@section installing_forcebalance Installing ForceBalance

ForceBalance is an ordinary Python module, so if you know how to install Python
modules, you shouldn't have any trouble with this.

@subsection installing_forcebalance_prereq Prerequisites

The only required software for installing ForceBalance are Python and
NumPy.  ForceBalance also allows the usage of SciPy optimizers; they
aren't as effective as the internal optimizer but still often helpful
- if you want to use these, then SciPy is needed.  A few more packages
are required if you want to \ref create_doc.  Here is a list of Python
packages and software:

Needed for ForceBalance:
@li Python version 2.7.1
@li NumPy version 1.5.0
@li SciPy version 0.9.0 (optional; needed for some of the non-default optimizers)
Needed for making documentation:
@li Doxygen version 1.7.6.1
@li Doxypy plugin for Doxygen
@li LaTeX software like TeXLive

@subsection installing_forcebalance_install Installing

To install the package, first extract the tarball that you downloaded from the
webpage using the command:

@verbatim tar xvzf ForceBalance-[version].tar.gz @endverbatim

Upon extracting the distribution you will notice this directory structure:

@verbatim
<root>
  +- bin
  |   |- <Executable scripts>
  +- forcebalance
  |   |- <Python module files>
  +- test
  |   +- <ForceBalance example jobs>
  +- doc
  |   +- callgraph
  |   |   |- <Stuff for making a call graph>
  |   +- Images
  |   |   |- <Images for the website and PDF manual>
  |   |- mainpage.py (Contains most user documentation and this text)
  |   |- header.tex (Customize the LaTex documentation)
  |   |- add-tabs.py (Adds more navigation tabs to the webpage)
  |   |- DoxygenLayout.xml (Removes a navigation tab from the webpage)
  |   |- doxygen.cfg (Main configuration file for Doxygen)
  |   |- ForceBalance-Manual.pdf (PDF manual, but the one on the SimTK website is probably newer)
  |- PKG-INFO (Auto-generated package information)
  |- README.txt (Points to the SimTK website)
  |- setup.py (Python script for installation)
@endverbatim

To install the code into your default Python location, run this (you might need to be root):

@verbatim python setup.py install @endverbatim

Alternatively, you can do a local install by running:

@verbatim python setup.py install --prefix=/home/your_username/local_directory @endverbatim

where you would of course replace your_username and local_directory with your username and preferred install location.  The executable scripts will be placed into <tt>/home/your_username/local_directory/bin</tt> and the module will be placed into <tt>/home/your_username/local_directory/lib/python[version]/site-packages/forcebalance</tt>.

Note that if you do a local installation, for Python to recognize the newly installed module you may need to append your PYTHONPATH environment variable using a command like the one below:

@verbatim export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/home/your_username/local_directory/lib/python[version] @endverbatim

@section install_gmxx2 Installing GROMACS-X2

GROMACS-X2 contains major modifications from GROMACS 4.0.7.
Most importantly, it enables computation of the objective function
<a>and its analytic derivatives</a> for rapid force matching.  There
is also an implementation of the QTPIE fluctuating-charge polarizable
force field, and the beginnings of a GROMACS/Q-Chem interface
(carefully implemented but not extensively tested).  Most of the
changes were added in several new source files (less than ten): \c
qtpie.c, \c fortune.c, \c fortune_utils.c, \c fortune_vsite.c, \c
fortune_nb_utils.c, \c zmatrix.c and their corresponding header files,
and \c fortunerec.h for the force matching struct.  The name 'fortune'
derives from back when this code was called ForTune.

The force matching functions are turned on by calling \c mdrun with
the command line argument \c '-fortune' ; without this option, there
should be no impact on the performance of normal MD simulations.

ForceBalance interfaces with GROMACS-X2 by calling the program
with special options and input files; the objective function and
derivatives are computed and printed to output files.  The interface
is defined in \c fortune.c on the GROMACS side and \c
forceenergymatch_gmxx2 on the Python side.  ForceBalance needs to know
where the GROMACS-X2 executables are located, and this is specified
using the \c gmxpath option in the input file.

@subsection install_gmxx2_prerequisites Prerequisites for GROMACS-X2

GROMACS-X2 needs the base GROMACS requirements and several other libraries.

@li FFTW version 3.3
@li GLib version 2.0
@li Intel MKL library

GLib is the utility library provided by the GNOME foundation (the
folks who make the GNOME desktop manager and GTK+ libraries).
GROMACS-X2 requires GLib for its hash table (dictionary)
implementation.

GLib and FFTW can be compiled from source, but it is much easier if
you're using a Linux distribution with a package manager.  If you're
running Ubuntu or Debian, run <tt>sudo apt-get install libglib2.0-dev
libfftw3-dev</tt>; if you're using CentOS or some other distro with
the yum package manager, run <tt>sudo yum install glib2-devel.x86_64
fftw3-devel.x86_64</tt> (or replace \c x86_64 with \c i386 if you're
not on a 64-bit system.

GROMACS-X2 requires the Intel Math Kernel Library (MKL) for linear algebra.
In principle this requirement can be lifted if I rewrite the source
code, but it's a lot of trouble, plus MKL is faster than other
implementations of BLAS and LAPACK.

The Intel MKL can be obtained from the Intel website, free of charge
for noncommercial use.  Currently GROMACS-X2 is built with MKL version
10.2, which ships with compiler version 11.1/072 ; this is not the
newest version, but it can still be obtained from the Intel website
after you register for a free account.

After installing these packages, extract the tarball that you downloaded
from the website using the command:

@verbatim tar xvjf gromacs-[version]-x2.tar.bz2 @endverbatim

The directory structure is identical to GROMACS 4.0.7, but I added
some shell scripts. \c Build.sh will run the configure script using
some special options, compile the objects, create the executables and
install them; you will probably need to modify it slightly for your
environment.  The comments in the script will help further
with installation.

Don't forget to specify the install location of the GROMACS-X2 executables
in the ForceBalance input file!

@section create_doc Create documentation

This documentation is created by Doxygen with the Doxypy plugin.
To create new documentation or expand on what's here, follow the
examples on the source code or visit the Doxygen home page.

To create this documentation from the source files, go to the \c doc
directory in the distribution and run <tt> doxygen doxygen.cfg </tt>
to generate the HTML documentation and LaTeX source files.  Run the \c
add-tabs.py script to generate the extra navigation tabs for the HTML
documentation.  Then go to the \c latex directory and type in <tt> make
</tt> to build the PDF manual (You might need a LaTeX distribution for
this.)
