# ForceBalance input file generated by MakeInputFile.py
# The octothorpe '#' is a comment symbol
# There are two sections, the main options ($options) and the target options ($target)
# A ForceBalance calculation will have one $options section and as one $target section per optimization target
# The most important options are listed at the top; options are also roughly grouped by their application
# Note: If the specified value is 'None' then the option will truly be set to None - not the string 'None'
# Note: Section option types are more complicated and may require you to read the documentation
# Note: Boolean option types require no value, the key being present implies 'True'
# Note: List option types are specified using spaces as the delimiter - i.e. forcefield ff1.itp ff2.itp ; delete empty brackets before use [] 

$options

# (list) The names of force fields, corresponding to directory forcefields/file_name.(itp,xml,prm,frcmod,mol2)
# used in: All (important)
forcefield dms.xml

# (allcap) The calculation type, defaults to a single-point evaluation of objective function.
# used in: All (important); choose "single", "gradient", "hessian", "newton" (Main Optimizer), "bfgs", "powell", "simplex", "anneal", "genetic", "conjugategradient", "scan_mvals", "scan_pvals", "fdcheck[gh]"

error_tolerance 1.0

# (float) Minimum trust radius (if the trust radius is tiny, then noisy optimizations become really gnarly)
# used in: Main Optimizer
