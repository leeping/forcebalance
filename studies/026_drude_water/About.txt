Note: This is just a test-study meant to show that ForceBalance is able to use
the AbInitio_OpenMM target to parameterize Drude particle parameters.
It is not recommended to actually use this, as fitting to conformational energies isn't
likely to reproduce an accurate polarizability for the Drude particles.
